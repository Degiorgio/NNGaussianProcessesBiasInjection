# NNGaussianProcessesBiasInjection

Neural networks infamously fail to generalise when dealing with small datasets  at least relative to non-parametric models such as Gaussian processes. This is a quick experiment, that attempts to inject the inductive biases assumed by the covariance function of a Gaussian processes into a neural network.
